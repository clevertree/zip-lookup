zip-lookup is a lightweight JSON based (no database) look-up script that uses a pre-configured
 list of json files to perform a zip-code look-up on (nearly) all available zip-codes. Simply
 add this library anywhere you have an address form in your websites and make your client's
 lives a little easier!

Test it out here:

http://ziplookup.googlecode.com/git/index.html

No installation required
To use it on your form, simply include

<script src="http://ziplookup.googlecode.com/git/zip-lookup/zip-lookup.min.js" type="text/javascript" ></script>
in your html header.

The script will listen for changes to any form field with the class

class='zip-lookup-field-zipcode'
and will attempt to look up the zipcode on change. The script will then update nearby fields with the following classes:

class='zip-lookup-field-city' => gets updated with city name
class='zip-lookup-field-state' => gets updated with state full name
class='zip-lookup-field-state-short' => gets updated with state short name
It's that easy! When the zip-code is found, the city, state and state abbreviation will be updated.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>Test zipLookup</title>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1" />
        <script src="http://ziplookup.googlecode.com/git/zip-lookup/zip-lookup.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <form>
            <legend>Test zip-lookup</legend>
            <div>Enter ZipCode:</div>
            <input type='text' name='zipcode' class='zip-lookup-field-zipcode' />
            <div>Enter City:</div>
            <input type='text' name='city' class='zip-lookup-field-city' />
            <div>Enter State:</div>
            <input type='text' name='state' class='zip-lookup-field-state' />
            <input type='text' name='state-short' class='zip-lookup-field-state-short' />
            <div class="zip-lookup-message info">Status</div>

    </body>
</html>

Authentication
It is not recommended to use this library for authentication of zip-codes. The primary reason is that zip-codes
 are added all the time, and someone's zip-code may not exist in this database in real-time.
